## Installation

### Quick Start

```bash
chmod +x quick-start.sh
./quick-start.sh
```

### Manual Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set environment variables:**
   ```bash
   export CANVA_CLIENT_ID='your_client_id_here'
   export CANVA_CLIENT_SECRET='your_client_secret_here'
   export CANVA_REDIRECT_URI='http://localhost:8001/auth/callback'  # Optional
   ```

4. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   For development with auto-reload:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

### Server Endpoints

Once running, the server provides:

- **SSE Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8001/mcp`
- **Message Post**: `http://localhost:8001/mcp/messages?sessionId={sessionId}`
- **OAuth Callback**: `http://localhost:8001/auth/callback`

### Authentication Flow

1. When a tool is first called without authentication, the server returns an OAuth authorization URL
2. The user visits this URL and authorizes the app
3. Canva redirects back to the callback URL with an authorization code
4. The server exchanges the code for access and refresh tokens
5. Subsequent requests use the stored access token (automatically refreshed when expired)

## API Reference

### Canva Connect API

This server uses the [Canva Connect API](https://www.canva.com/developers/docs/connect-api/). Key endpoints:

- **Designs**: `/v1/designs` - Design management
- **Assets**: `/v1/assets`, `/v1/url-asset-uploads` - Asset operations
- **Folders**: `/v1/folders` - Folder management
- **Comments**: `/v1/designs/{id}/comments` - Collaboration
- **Design Generation**: `/v1/designs/generate` - AI generation
- **Design Editing**: `/v1/designs/{id}/edit` - Content editing

### OAuth 2.0 with PKCE

The server implements OAuth 2.0 with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for enhanced security:

1. Generate code verifier and challenge
2. Redirect user to authorization URL
3. Receive authorization code via callback
4. Exchange code for access and refresh tokens
5. Automatically refresh expired tokens

## Security Considerations

- **Token Storage**: Tokens are stored in memory. For production, use a secure database.
- **State Management**: OAuth state is validated to prevent CSRF attacks.
- **Token Refresh**: Access tokens are automatically refreshed with a 5-minute buffer.
- **PKCE**: Uses PKCE for enhanced OAuth security.

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing scopes: [asset:write]" Error

If you receive this error:
1. Disconnect the integration from Canva
2. Reconnect by visiting the OAuth URL again
3. The new token will include the required scope

### OAuth Callback Issues

Ensure your redirect URI matches exactly:
- Server default: `http://localhost:8001/auth/callback`
- Must be added to your Canva app settings
- Use the same URI in your environment variable

### Port Already in Use

If port 8001 is in use, change it:
```bash
export PORT=8002
npm start
```

### Token Expiration

Access tokens expire after a certain period. The server automatically refreshes them using the refresh token. If you see authentication errors:
1. Clear the session
2. Re-authenticate by calling any tool

## Rate Limits

Canva API has rate limits:
- **Asset Uploads**: 30 requests per minute per user
- Other endpoints have their own limits (refer to Canva API documentation)

The server doesn't implement rate limiting - consider adding this for production use.
